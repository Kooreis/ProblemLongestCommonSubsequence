# Question: How do you find the longest common subsequence between two strings? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `lcs(X, Y)` finds the longest common subsequence between two strings, X and Y. It uses a dynamic programming approach, which breaks down the problem into smaller, simpler subproblems and stores the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. The function first initializes a two-dimensional array, L, with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings X and Y respectively. This array is used to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all possible pairs of substrings of X and Y. The function then iterates over the characters of X and Y. If the current characters of X and Y are the same, it increments the length of the longest common subsequence found so far. If they are different, it takes the maximum length found so far. After filling the array, the function constructs the longest common subsequence by tracing back from the bottom right corner of the array to the top left corner. It compares the characters of X and Y and if they are the same, it includes the character in the subsequence. If they are different, it moves in the direction of the larger of the two adjacent values in the array. The function finally returns the longest common subsequence as a string.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall approach to solving the problem. Both versions use dynamic programming to build a matrix of longest common subsequences and then return the longest common subsequence found at the bottom right of the matrix.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. Type Annotations: In TypeScript, the function parameters `str1` and `str2` are explicitly annotated with the `string` type. This is a feature of TypeScript that is not available in JavaScript. It provides a way to ensure that the function is called with the correct types of arguments.

2. Different Variable Names: The TypeScript version uses different variable names (`str1`, `str2`, `matrix`) compared to the JavaScript version (`X`, `Y`, `L`). This doesn't affect the functionality of the code, but it can make the TypeScript version easier to understand because the variable names are more descriptive.

3. Different Initialization of Matrix: In the JavaScript version, the matrix is initialized with zeros. In the TypeScript version, the matrix is initialized with empty strings. This is because the TypeScript version directly constructs the longest common subsequence in the matrix, while the JavaScript version constructs it separately after filling the matrix.

4. Different Comparison of Matrix Values: In the JavaScript version, the lengths of the longest common subsequences are compared using the `Math.max` function. In the TypeScript version, the lengths are compared using a ternary operator. This is a stylistic difference and doesn't affect the functionality of the code.

5. Different Construction of Longest Common Subsequence: In the JavaScript version, the longest common subsequence is constructed by tracing back from the bottom right corner of the matrix. In the TypeScript version, the longest common subsequence is directly obtained from the bottom right corner of the matrix. This is because the TypeScript version directly constructs the longest common subsequence in the matrix, while the JavaScript version constructs it separately after filling the matrix.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar dynamic programming approach to the JavaScript version. Both versions create a 2D array (or vector in C++) to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences for different substrings of the input strings. They then fill this array by comparing the characters of the input strings. If the current characters are the same, they increment the length of the longest common subsequence found so far. If the current characters are different, they take the maximum length found so far. Finally, they construct the longest common subsequence by tracing back from the bottom right corner of the array.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Array Initialization: In JavaScript, arrays are initialized using the `Array` constructor and the `fill` and `map` methods. In C++, vectors (which are similar to arrays) are initialized using the `vector` constructor.

2. String Concatenation: In JavaScript, strings are concatenated using the `+` operator or the `concat` method. In C++, strings are concatenated using the `+` operator.

3. Input/Output: In JavaScript, input is typically taken from an HTML form or prompt, and output is typically displayed in an HTML element or console. In C++, input is taken from the standard input (usually the keyboard) using the `cin` object, and output is displayed on the standard output (usually the console) using the `cout` object.

4. Type Declaration: In JavaScript, variables are declared with `let` or `const` and are dynamically typed. In C++, variables are declared with their specific types (e.g., `int`, `string`, `vector<int>`).

5. Function Declaration: In JavaScript, functions are declared with the `function` keyword. In C++, functions are declared with their return type (e.g., `string`), and they can be declared at any point in the code before they are called.
